# Kaggle-competitions
Kaggle competition is a data science competition where data from different companies and public institutes are provided for analysis. In Kaggle, we choose a particular competition and we download its training datasets. Next step is, building a model using our choice of methods or tools. Finally, the predications are uploaded and Kaggle scores the solution, which are then displayed on the leaderboard. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions


# San Francisco crime prediction
"From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz. Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay."
SF OpenData (https://data.sfgov.org), has provided nearly 12 years of crime reports from across all of San Francisco's neighborhoods. In this datasets, categories of crimes based on occurance time (between 1/1/2003 to 5/13/2015) and location(Geographic coordination system) are given. The data are devived to the training set and test set in a way that weeks 1,3,5,7... belong to test set and weeks 2,4,6,8 belong to training set.

In this competition, we are expected to predict the category of crimes that occurred in the city. I participated in the comepetition and here, I am going to show you my proposed algorithms, codes and results.
